# SENG301 Assignment 1 (2020) - student answers


## Task 1 - Identify the patterns

### Pattern 1 -  Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory Pattern

- What pattern is it?  Abstract Factory Pattern
- What is its goal in the code? As shown in my UML Class diagram, the Abstract Factory Pattern
is used when preparing an order. preparingOrder.java uses the information provided by user to
choose what factory and egg type to use and produce, without the need of a specific egg or factory classes needing to be specified

- Mapping to GoF pattern elements:

| GoF element           | Code element          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|           AbstractCreator            |             ChocolateEggFactory.java          |
|           ConcreteCreator           |             StuffedEggFactory.java          |

|           AbstractProduct            |             ChocolateEgg.java          |
|           ConcreteProduct           |             StuffedChocolateEgg.java          |
|           ConcreteProduct           |             HollowChocolateEgg.java          |
